        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
    Hello! I'm just getting started on my journey as a developer, learning how to build things for the web and diving into the world of machine learning.
    Right now, I'm focused on learning the basics — creating responsive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and exploring how Python and machine learning
    can be used to solve real-world problems.
    <br><br>
    I do not  have years of experience (yet!), but I am a quick learner who loves experimenting, building small projects, and figuring things out one step at a time.
    Recently, I built my first journaling app that uses simple AI to help users remember important notes — and it is just the beginning.
    <br><br>
    What excites me most is the idea of combining creativity with logic — designing interfaces people enjoy using, and building intelligent tools that make life easier.
    This portfolio is a snapshot of what I have learned so far, and I am really looking forward to where this path takes me next.

            <h3>JournAI</h3>
            <p>JournAI is an AI-powered online journaling platform developed using HTML, CSS, and Python, integrating a RAG model to enhance user interaction and memory recall. Acting as a digital second brain, it allows users to record their experiences and intelligently retrieve past entries or specific contact-related information. By leveraging the RAG model, JournAI combines document retrieval with generative AI to provide accurate, context-aware responses, making memory search more intuitive and meaningful. The platform is designed to reduce cognitive load by delivering structured, AI-assisted insights that help users reflect, remember, and organize their thoughts more effectively.</p>
